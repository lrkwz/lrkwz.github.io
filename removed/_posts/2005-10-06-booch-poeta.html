In dance, by the way, some attempts have been made to define a  graphical notation (labanotation) for describing dance movements, just as we  have the UML for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting  software-intensive systems.</EM>"</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I blog di Booch da un lato e Irving Wladawsky-Berger  dall'altro mi sembrano sempre pi√π ricchi di spunti  interessanti.</FONT></P>
