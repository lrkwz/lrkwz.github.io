As some of you know I've released an open source <a href="http://lrkwz.github.com/jCryptionSpring/" target="_blank">integration for spring with jCryption</a>.<br />In the very beginning of this story I've hosted my source code on gitorious then I switched to github because of a better integrated environment (issues, wiki, ...) and generally speaking a much more "<i>alive environment</i>".<br /><br />Today I've been astonished by the features given to free accounts on <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/" target="_blank">cloudbees</a> PaaS!<br /><br />In few minutes I've been able to clone my git repository to cloudbees (still maintaining the github one ... and the gitorios as a sort of thermonuclear disaster recovery plan), create a jenkins build job and deploy my app <a href="http://jcryptionspring-sample.lrkwz.cloudbees.net/" target="_blank">into the cloud</a>.<br />Next will be the maven artifact repository use, now I'm using the sonatype one to deliver release artifacts to maven central ... see you!
