<div class="mobile-post">I've done it at least!<br /> I've been a mod_md5 fanatic since 2001: it is a light apache<br />module distributed open source by http://www.frogdot.org/, it performs a<br />cookie based form authentication.<br />Apache does cookie verification and delegates to a servlet/jsp container<br />the actual identity check.<br />I think it's quite effective since both http server and application<br />server share the same authentication.<br />If you don't want to integrate/extend the app server authentication in<br />ordedr to provide the correct cookie generation mechanism you can simply<br />delegate it back to apache setting  tomcatAuthentication="false" in your<br />server.xml configuration file.</div>
