It isn't the first time ... refactoring a module (well actually I'm transforming and extensions which was incompatible with another installed one) I realized that only the admin panels were working, the product page nearly disappeared: header and footer plus sidebar but no product contents at all.<br /><br />After validating all the mappings, blocks etc etc it ended up that I accidentally reformat the config.xml ... a new-line was dropped after the class name !<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint lang-xml">&lt;catalog&gt;<br />   &lt;rewrite&gt;<br />     &lt;product_view_options_type_select&gt;Companyname_Modulename_Block_Product_View_Options_Type_Select<br />&lt;/product_view_options_type_select&gt;<br />   &lt;/rewrite&gt;<br />&lt;/catalog&gt;<br /></pre>Magento's XML parser fails to match the class name resulting in the empty page.<br /><br />In my opinion the new-line should be read only inside a CNAME delimited section.
